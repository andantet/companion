* Converted Parkour Warrior: Dojo challenge runs to a new format
  * This update has been released mainly to get you all on the new format as quick as possible! Apologies for the lack of Parkour Warrior: Survivor support, though that is in progress!
  * The game now saves and loads entire challenge runs (instead of just their timelines before), which will allow for more functionality in the future
  * The game now also saves information about the runner to the challenge run file (the player's name and unique identifier)


* Added support for 'Section' and 'Final' branch types from Parkour Warrior: Survivor
